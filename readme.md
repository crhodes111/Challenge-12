## Title and Description
Challenge 12 for UNCC Coding Bootcamp.

In this challenge we were tasked with creating a employee tracker in Node using inquirer and MySQL2.
Once the app is started a menu is displayed giving options to the user to view the employees, roles and departments in the database. Users are able to add roles and employees to the database. Users are also able to update the roles of the employees.
